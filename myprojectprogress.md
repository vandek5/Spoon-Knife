With my project, the multi computer assistant toolkit thingy, I'm not sure how
I'd like to organize it. I generally like the blessed repository model, but I
do think that the creation of many different repositories in unwieldy... So,
I was considering having maybe a "blessed set ofbranches" and individual
developers can have their own set of branches, following the format of say, 
"dev1/feature1" and "dev2/coolfeature" with the blessed branches being
"main/hotfix" or "main/main" etc...

I'm not sure yet though and may just use the blessed repository model anyway.
